%GM_PHD_Simulate_Measurements
%Matlab code by Bryan Clarke b.clarke@acfr.usyd.edu.au 

%This file generates simulated measurement data for  the simulation
%described in Vo&Ma.
%There will be gaussian noise on the measurement and Poisson-distributed clutter
%in the environment. 

%If you want to use this PHD filter implementation for another problem, you
%will need to replace this script with another one that populates Z,
%zTrue, and simMeasurementHistory (Z is used in a lot of the update code,
%zTrue and simMeasurementHistory are used in GM_PHD_Simulate_Plot)

%Note: It is possible to get no measurements if the target is not detected
%and there is no clutter
s = sprintf('Step Sim: Simulating measurements.');
disp(s);

%Simulate target movement
simTarget1State = F * simTarget1State;
simTarget2State = F * simTarget2State;
simTarget3State = F * simTarget3State;


%Save target movement for plotting
simTarget1History = [simTarget1History, simTarget1State];
simTarget2History = [simTarget2History, simTarget2State];
simTarget3History = [simTarget3History, simTarget3State];

%First, we generate some clutter in the environment.
clutter = zeros(2,nClutter);%The observations are of the form [x; y]
for i = 1:nClutter
    clutterX = rand * (xrange(2) - xrange(1)) + xrange(1); %Random number between xrange(1) and xrange(2), uniformly distributed.
    clutterY = rand * (yrange(2) - yrange(1)) + yrange(1); %Random number between yrange(1) and yrange(2), uniformly distributed.
    
    clutter(1,i) = clutterX;
    clutter(2,i) = clutterY;
end

%We are not guaranteed to detect the target - there is only a probability

detect1 = rand;
detect2 = rand;
detect3 = rand;

    measX1 = [];

    measY1 = simTarget1State(2) + sigma_r * randn * noiseScaler;
