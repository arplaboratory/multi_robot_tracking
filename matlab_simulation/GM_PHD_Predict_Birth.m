%GM_PHD_Predict_Birth
%Matlab code by Bryan Clarke b.clarke@acfr.usyd.edu.au 

%This file performs prediction for newly birthed and spawned targets
%This is necessary since their positions were initialised in a previous timestep and they may
%have moved between then and now
%We iterate through j = 1..J_b,k where J_b,k is number of birthed landmarks
%at time k (but the landmarks correspond to the measurement from time k-1)
%and j = 1...J_s,k where J_s,k is the number of spawned landmarks at time k
%(but the landmarks correspond to the measurement from time k-1).
%For this implementation, birthed and spawned targets are identical except
%they have weights that are calculated from different functions, and
%different starting covariances. A target is spawned or birthed depending
%on which weighting function will give it a higher starting weight.

%The means of these will be the position in Cartesian space where they are detected
%The covariances & weights are calculated according to Vo&Ma
