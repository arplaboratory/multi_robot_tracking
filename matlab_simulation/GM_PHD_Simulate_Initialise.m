%GM_PHD_Simulate_Initialise
%Matlab code by Bryan Clarke b.clarke@acfr.usyd.edu.au 

%This file initialises the simulation described in example 1 of Vo&Ma 2006.
%The velocity and starting position values are rough estimates obtained by visual
%inspection of the simulation. 
%They can probably be changed without things breaking.

%If you want to use this GM-PHD filter for your own problem, you will need
%to replace this script with your own.

%%Control parameters
noiseScaler = 1.0;       %Adjust the strength of the noise on the measurements by adjusting this. Useful for debugging.
nClutter = 1; %Assume constant 50 clutter measurements. Since clutter is Poisson distrbuted it might be more accurate to use nClutter = poissrnd(50) if you have the required Matlab toolbox. Constant 50 clutter works well enough for simulation purposes.

%I haven't included descriptions of every variable because their names are
%fairly self-explanatory
endTime = 100;%Duration of main loop
